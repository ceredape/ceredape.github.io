						<h1>About Me</h1>
					</header>
                    <p>I have been around computers and games since my early years. After finishing graduating high school I attended an Electromecanic Engineer university. A few years later, I realized that my heart truly belonged to programming so I changed to a technical programming course. As good as the course was, I discovered I wasn't interested in Web development. After learning all I could about game development by myself, mostly from the internet (which was fun for a few months), I instantly knew I needed to learn the right way.</p>
                    <p>That's how I left my country, Argentina to Spain, to one of the best game schools available, ESAT, where after a lot of effort, I finally (and happily) graduated from. Right after finishing college, I decided to go back to my country and make use of all the new knowledge and skills I had acquired. </p>

						<h2>Technical Profile</h2>

						<p>I love creating new mechanics or programming the core and rules of games. I also enjoy making
							tools for artists.
							I'm not so interested in graphic/engine programming but I do like tweaking shaders and
							optimization techniques.</p>


						<p>Here is a list of the main tools that I feel more comfortable using:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Unreal Engine 4</b></li>
							<p>We used UE4 the last year and a half, and we made a lot of projects using almost every
								tool that offers; state machines, behavior trees,
								AI with EQS, profiling tools, lighting tweaks, data persistence, materials, widgets,
								etc...</p>

							<li><b>C++</b></li>
							<p>The entire career was focused in C++ and we developed most of the applications using this
								language, combined with ESAT graphics library. Most of the work done in UE4 was
								implemented in code with some extended functionality going through Blueprints.</p>

							<li><b>Unity 3D</b></li>
							<p>Unity was the engine where we learned mostly game design the first years. I made a lot of
								little games that felt well for the little time that we had available.</p>
						</ul>

						<p><b>Other languages that we used:</b> C, C#, Java (Android Studio), Swift, HTML5 + javascript
							+ CSS, phyton, bash scripting, SQL.</p>

						<p><b>Version control software:</b> Perforce, Git.</p>

                        <p><b>Scrum</b> methodology usage with Trello.</p>
                        
						<h2>Languages:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Spanish: native language</li>
							<li>English: medium-advanced level</li>
						</ul>

						<hr />
						<h2>Official Degree</h2>
						<p>Pearson BTEC Level 5 HND Diploma in Computing and System Development
							<br>With MERIT
							<br>Awarded: July 2019</p>
