						<h2>About Me</h2>
					</header>
                    <p>I have been around computers and games since my early years. After graduating from high school I attended an Electromecanic Engineer university. 
					A few years later, I realized that my heart truly belonged to programming so I changed to a technical programming course. As good as the course was, 
					I discovered the world of video-games development, which made the course look really lacking.</p>
                    
					<p>Long story short, I left Argentina to study at ESAT, a well known Spanish game develompemnt school.
					It was a really challenging three years road, and I'm very proud to say that I got to the end of it. Right after finishing college, I decided return to my country back with my family and friends. A month later I joined Aconcagua Software, 
					where I'm really happy to be at, working as a Unity enigneer.</p>

					<p>Currently I am looking forward to keep growing, in a search for challenging projects and passionate people to work with.</p>

						<h2>Profile</h2>

						<p>I love creating new features, implementing mechanics, programming the core and rules of games. 
						But I won't lie, solving bugs is something that I consider myself pretty good at.</p>

						<p>I have a very good understanding on how to programm solid, reusable, performant peaces of code.
						I'd rather go a little further with my implementations or when patching someone else's code for the sake of everyone.</p>

						<p>When I programm I'm usually a lonely guy. I keep communication open though, always joking around with other programmers/artists, asking question or raising concerns when it's needed.</p>


						<h2>Technologies</h2>
						<p>I'd work in wathever engine it's needed. Language it's not a limitant factor either. I have a very good C++ and C# understanding and I've worked with both mainstream engines.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><b>Unreal Engine 4</b></li>
							<p>We used UE4 the last year and a half at the university, and we made a lot of projects using most of the
								tools that offers; state machines, behavior trees,
								AI with EQS, profiling tools, lighting tweaks, data persistence, materials, widgets,
								etc...</p>

							<li><b>Unity 3D</b></li>
							<p>Unity is the engine where we learned mostly game design the first years. I made a lot of
								little games that felt well for the little time that we had available. Now, I've been using Unity professionally for two years now.</p>
						</ul>

						<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
						
						<h3>Aconcagua Software</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Realwear HMT-1 AR projects for Atos and IVECO. Made in Unity</b></li>

							<li><b>Pipeworks Studios</b></li>
							<p>I've been contracted for Pipeworks for a little short of two years, in a considerably big multiplayer/multi-platform, server driven Unity game. 
								Mostly as a UI engineer, my work has consisted on fixing bugs, implementing new features, refactoring and improving old code,
								documenting architectural or performance issues and going forward with viable solutions.</p>
						</ul>

						<p><b>Version control software:</b> Perforce, Git.</p>
