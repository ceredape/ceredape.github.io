                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The curiosity for understanding how electronics work took me to apply for an Electromechanical
                    engineering career.
                    In the second year we had some programming courses, I was amazed and hooked by them, so I changed
                    paths. One year later with some good programming foundations
                    my gamer me started to question if I could be a game developer. The course I was in wasn't remotelly
                    close to fulfill that goal,
                    and folliwing tutorials in Youtube felt like I wasn't getting nowhere near to understanding the
                    whole process.</p>

                <p>I left Argentina to study at ESAT, a well known and and recognized Spanish game development school. </p>

                    <img src="images/dreamHack.jpg" alt="graduation" width="506" height="300"></div>
                <br>
                <p>Right after finishing college,
                    I decided return to my country back with my family and friends where I joined Aconcagua Software, where my profesional career as a programmer started. 
                    After that I worked in Spellslingers and now in The Sandbox.</p>

                <p>Currently I am looking forward to keep growing, in search of challenging projects and passionate
                    people to work with. </p>

                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>
                    I love implementing new features and mechanics, programming the core and rules of games.
                    Solving bugs is something that I consider myself pretty good at. I've also gained some interest in leadership.
                </p>
                <h4>I believe in:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Respectful communication.</li>
                    <li>Hard work.</li>
                    <li>Honesty, sincerity, transparency.</li>
                </ul>
