					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The curiosity for understanding how electronics work took me to apply for an Electromechanical
					engineering career.
					In the second year we had some programming courses, I was amazed and hooked by them, so I changed
					paths. One year later with some good programming foundations
					my gamer me started to question if I could be a game developer. The course I was in wasn't remotelly
					close to fulfill that goal,
					and folliwing tutorials in Youtube felt like I wasn't getting nowhere near to understanding the
					whole process.</p>

				<p>I left Argentina to study at ESAT, a well known Spanish game development school. I've had been
					promised teachers with real experience in the field,
					three years of hell and sacrifice, and ending the career as a capable professional game programmer,
					and boy, they weren't wrong. </p>

				<p>Right after finishing college,
					I decided return to my country back with my family and friends.
					A month later I joined Aconcagua Software, where I'm really fortunate to be working as a Unity
					engineer.</p>
				
				<p>Currently I am looking forward to keep growing, in search of challenging projects and passionate
					people to work with.
					Complex multiplayer games are of an special interest for me, and I'll head my career in that
					direction, step by step someday I'll be there.</p>

				<hr/>
				<h2>Profile</h2>
				<p>
					I love implementing new features and mechanics, programming the core and rules of games.
					Solving bugs is something that I consider myself pretty good at.

					Not a huge fan of engine or graphic programming, but I have a fairly good superficial understanding
					of
					those fields.
				</p>
				<h4>I believe in:</h4>
				<ul>

					<li>Good programming practices. Reducing code complexity.</li>
					<li>Respectful communication. Not being afraid of asking questions.</li>
					<li>Hard work. Never doing the bare minimum a project requires.</li>
					<li>Not forgetting that kindsness and playfullness it's a need for a healthy team.</li>
				</ul>

				<hr/>
				<h2>Technologies</h2>
				<p>I have a very good C++ and C# understanding and I've worked with both mainstream engines:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Unreal Engine 4</b></li>
					<p>We used UE4 the last year and a half at the university, and we made a lot of projects using most
						of the
						tools that offers; state machines, behavior trees,
						AI with EQS, profiling tools, lighting, data persistence, materials, widgets,
						etc...</p>

					<li><b>Unity 3D</b></li>
					<p>I've been using Unity professionally for two years now. It's also where we learned mostly game
						design the first years at the University. </p>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Version control software:</b> Perforce, Git.</p>

				<hr/>
				<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

				<h3>Aconcagua Software -</h3>
				<ul>
					(2019 / 2020)<br/>
					<li>(<b>Realwear HMT-1 AR projects for Atos and IVECO. Made in Unity</b></li>

					<br/>

					(2020 / Present)<br/>
					<li><b>Pipeworks Studios</b></li>
					<p>I've been contracted for Pipeworks for two years now, working in Magic Spellslingers project by
						Wizards of the Coast.
						<br/><br/>Mostly as a UI engineer, my work has consisted on implementing new features, refactoring and
						improving old code, fixing bugs,
						documenting architectural or performance issues and going forward with viable solutions. I've
						also received some arquitectural tasks
						that aren't related to UI, like fixing the integration of Android monetization IAP. </p>
				</ul>
